PeerGuardian is an open source IP filter that is designed to block the IP addresses of certain organizations and corporations that may wish to harm a users privacy while using the Internet and peer-to-peer networks.


PeerGuardian 2 requires no driver installation, yet blocks IP addresses at a far higher speed than was previously available - never above 1% CPU on most test systems. On Windows 2000 and greater PeerGuardian 2 blocks at a kernel level, acting against every protocol used within the windows system. On Windows 98 or Me it blocks TCP only (due to technical reasons, kernel blocking in 98/ME is not feasible) with the same high performance of the Windows 2000 version.


PeerGuardian blocks IP addresses based upon a list of IP addresses collected by many methods. By default, PeerGuardian 2 collects IP addresses from the Blocklist.org website. Blocklist.org is a website designed to allow users to interactively manage and block the IP addresses of certain organisations and companies. Founded in early 2005 by phoenixlabs.org, it is intended to be a platform agnostic database that utilises published open formats.

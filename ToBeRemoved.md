= Future plans =

Feature or a module which is tagged with this is scheduled to be removed at some point in the future. There may already exists a better alternative for this feature or it may be under planning. In some cases this functionality may be axed off completely.

Keep this in mind when using such features and upgrading. Later versions may need some (small) changes in your configuration file to continue working. If alternative better modules are available, always prefer them.

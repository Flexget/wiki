= Limit New =

Limit number of new items.

Example:

{{{
limit_new: 1
}}}

This would allow only n-number of new items to pass trough per execution.
Useful for passing torrents slowly into download.
        
Note that since this is per execution, actual rate depends how often
!FlexGet is executed.

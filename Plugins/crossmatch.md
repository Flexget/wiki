# Crossmatch
Match current entries against some other input entries and take action on matches.


| **Option** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| from | List of input plugins |
| fields | List of entry fields which are matched from current task against entries generated by the plugins in `from` option |
| action | `accept` or `reject` |
| exact | `yes` or `no` Default is yes |


## Examples

### Reject movies rated in imdb
Reject movies that you have already voted on imdb. This would be used in a task.

```yaml
crossmatch:
  from:
    - imdb_list:
        user_id: ur9999999
        list: ratings
  fields:
    - imdb_id
  action: reject
```

You will also need to enable [imdb_lookup](/Plugins/imdb_lookup) on the feed in order to get imdb_id populated. Granted, this is a lot more complicated than old imdb_rated used to be, but crossmatch allows all kinds of other clever uses as well.

### Organize movies you rated badly
You could use [delete](/Plugins/delete) at your own risk.

```yaml
tasks:

  sort-rated-movies:
    interval: 1 days
    history: no
    seen: no
    filesystem:
      - /path/to/collection
    imdb_lookup: yes
    crossmatch:
      from:
        - imdb_list:
            list: ratings
            login: '\{{ secrets.imdb.login }}'
            password: '\{{ secrets.imdb.pwd }}'
      fields:
        - imdb_id
      action: accept
    require_field:
      - imdb_score
      - imdb_user_score
    if:
      - imdb_user_score < 7: accept
    move:
      allow_dir: yes
      to: /path/to/crap
```

See [secrets](/Plugins/secrets) plugin

### Accept files any entries from a Filesystem list 
The task will accept any entry containing an Artist's name (assumes /media/artists/ contains a folder for each Artist)

```yaml
rss:
  url: http://example.com/rss.xml
crossmatch:
  from:
	- filesystem:
	  - /media/artists/
  fields:
	- title
  action: accept
  exact: no
```

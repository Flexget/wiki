# Crossmatch
Match current entries against some other input entries and take action on matches. 

Note that all matching entries created in `from` will be merged into corresponding task entry. 

| **Option** | **Description** | **Default** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| from | List of input plugins | |
| fields | List of entry fields which are matched from current task against entries generated by the plugins in `from` option | |
| action | `accept` or `reject` |
| exact | `yes` or `no` | `yes` |
|all_fields|Require all fields to match. `yes` or `no`. | `no` |
|case_sensitive|Case sensitive match. `yes` or `no`. | `yes` |

## Examples

### Reject movies rated in imdb
Reject movies that you have already voted on imdb. This would be used in a task.

```yaml
crossmatch:
  from:
    - imdb_watchlist:
        user_id: ur9999999
        list: ratings
  fields:
    - imdb_id
  action: reject
```

You will also need to enable [imdb_lookup](/Plugins/imdb_lookup) on the task in order to get imdb_id populated. Granted, this is a lot more complicated than old imdb_rated used to be, but crossmatch allows all kinds of other clever uses as well.

### Organize rated movies

Move imdb rated (watched) movies into another location.

```yaml
interval: 1 days
filesystem: /path/to/movies/
seen: no
history: no
imdb_lookup: yes
crossmatch:
  from:
    - imdb_watchlist:
        list: ratings
        user_id: '{? imdb.user_id ?}'
  fields:
    - imdb_id
  action: accept
move:
  allow_dir: yes
  to: /path/to/movies-rated/
```

### Organize movies you rated badly

> DOES NOT WORK CORRECTLY DUE PLUGIN ORDER
{.is-danger}

```yaml
tasks:

  sort-rated-movies:
    interval: 1 days
    history: no
    seen: no
    filesystem:
      - /path/to/collection
    imdb_lookup: yes
    crossmatch:
      from:
        - imdb_list:
            list: ratings
            login: '{? imdb.login ?}'
            password: '{? imdb.pwd ?}'
      fields:
        - imdb_id
      action: accept
    require_field:
      - imdb_score
      - imdb_user_score
    if:
      - imdb_user_score < 7: accept
      - imdb_user_score > 7: reject # since crossmatch accepted everything
    move:
      allow_dir: yes
      to: /path/to/crap
```

See [variables](/Plugins/variables) plugin.

### Accept files any entries from a Filesystem list 
The task will accept any entry containing an Artist's name (assumes /media/artists/ contains a folder for each Artist)

```yaml
rss:
  url: http://example.com/rss.xml
crossmatch:
  from:
    - filesystem: /media/artists/
  fields:
    - title
  action: accept
  exact: no
```

# Add Trackers
Adds the listed trackers to any torrents grabbed by the feed. Also works on magnet urls.

### Example
```
add_trackers:
  - http://tracker1.com/announce
  - udp://tracker2.com/announce
```

TIP: You can use [global preset](/Plugins/preset) in configuration to make this enabled on all feeds.

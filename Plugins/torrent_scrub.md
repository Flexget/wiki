= Torrent metafile scrubber =

Removes resume information and other non-standard data from torrent downloads. Note that this resume information prevents the torrent from properly starting in Rtorrent, and is added by ruTorrent users if they incorrectly check the "Fast Resume" option while creating a torrent for uploading.


== Configuration ==

There is only one settings which determines what kind of metadata is removed from torrents:
 torrent_scrub:: One of `off` (almost equivalent to commenting it out), `on` (normal scrubbing, all custom keys on top-level), `all` (any custom key, also within the info dict; never use this on fresh downloads, it can modify the info hash), `resume` (just libtorrent fast-resume information), or `rtorrent` (any special Rtorrent metadata).
 [[BR]][[BR]]
 Or you provide an explicit list of names you want to have removed; if they refer to inner dictionaries, use a '.' to separate key names (e.g. `info.source`).

Rtorrent users should use `rtorrent`, so that incoming torrents never contain keys that modify the client's behaviour.

== Examples ==

To scrub one task:
{{{
tasks:
  rutorrent-fast-resume-infected-task:
    torrent_scrub: rtorrent
}}}

If you want to be sure that all tasks are scrubbed, because you can never know, use this:
{{{
presets:
  global:
    torrent_scrub: rtorrent
}}}

To scrub a list of keys you provide:
{{{
...
    torrent_scrub:
      - comment
      - info.source
}}}
Again, anything that changes the "info" dict, like the 2nd entry above, changes the info hash, which isn't wise for downloading purposes.

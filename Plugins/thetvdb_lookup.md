= TheTVDB Lookup =

For most purposes, the series name is sufficient to get a match on TheTVDB. If you can't get a match (e.g., multiple IDs defined for a series name) then you can provide the thetvdb_id from their website to bypass the matching process.

{{{
series:
  - some_series:
      set:
        thetvdb_id: <thetvdb_id>
}}}

'''Example:'''

The most common use is to look up an episode title that can be used to format a pretty filename. This example uses {{{ep_name}}} as parsed by thetvdb_lookup in the [wiki:Plugins/set set] plugin to set {{{content_filename}}} (which the [wiki:Plugins/deluge deluge] plugin uses to rename the main file within a torrent.) The 'default' jinja filter is used to insert 'Unknown' if thetvdb_lookup fails to get an ep_name for the entry.
{{{
thetvdb_lookup: yes
set:
  content_filename: "{{ series_name }} - {{ series_id }} - {{ ep_name|default('Unknown') }}  - {{ quality|upper }}"
}}}

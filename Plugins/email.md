= Email =

The email plugin can be used to notify you of task results and/or failures. There are two built in templates, or you can make your own template using the Jinja2 templating language.

The {{{default}}} template will notify you of all downloaded entries, and of any failed entries or task aborts. There is also an included {{{failed}}} template to just notify when there are problems with a task.

== Config ==
The email plugin is special, in that it can be configured for a task directly, or it can be set up at the root of the config, in order to receive one email with the results of all of your tasks. The configuration options for both of these locations are the same:

{{{
  from          : the email address from which the email will be sent (required)
  to            : the email address(es) of the recipient(s) (required)
  subject       : the subject for the email (jinja replacement is supported)
  template      : name of the template file to use (default will be used if not specified)
  smtp_host     : the host of the smtp server
  smtp_port     : the port of the smtp server
  smtp_username : the username to use to connect to the smtp server
  smtp_password : the password to use to connect to the smtp server
  smtp_tls      : should we use TLS to connect to the smtp server?
  smtp_ssl      : should we use SSL to connect to the smtp server?
  active        : should this task be included in the global email?
}}}
'''Default values for the config elements'''

{{{
  active: True
  smtp_host: localhost
  smtp_port: 25
  smtp_username:
  smtp_password:
}}}

=== Built-In Templates ===

Here are the templates that come built in.
 default:: This will send emails with a list of accepted entries, and/or a list of failed entries. (this template is used automatically if you do not specify one.)
 failed:: This will only send emails when there are entries that have failed.
 accepted:: This will only send emails about accepted entries.
 html:: This attempts to make html formatted emails with images for series and movies.

=== Custom Templates ===

You can create your own custom templates for the email plugin in the jinja2 templating language. They should be placed in <configpath>/templates, and their filename specified as the {{{template}}} option. See the [http://flexget.com/browser/trunk/flexget/templates/email/default.template default template] for an example.

=== Examples ===

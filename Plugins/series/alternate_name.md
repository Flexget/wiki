= Alternate Name =
If a series is released under multiple names, you can use this option to define them. For example, original and translated name for a series.

Example:
{{{
series:
  - My Series:
      alternate_name: Meiner Serie
}}}

If more than one alternate name is needed, the option can be specified as a list:
{{{
series:
  - The Show:
      alternate_name:
        - De Show
        - Le Show
}}}

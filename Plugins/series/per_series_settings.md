== Per series settings ==

When specifying a setting for a series, you must add a colon to the end of the series name, and add 4 more spaces before the setting name:

{{{
series:
  - series name:
      [setting]: [value]
}}}

For example, with [wiki:Plugins/series/quality quality] settings:

{{{
series:
  - Series 1
  - Series 2:
      quality: hdtv
  - Series 3:
      quality: 720p
}}}

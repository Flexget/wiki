= Magnets =
This plugin will remove any magnet links from the urls list, and reject any entries that only have magnet links. (Since torrent_cache is a built-in plugin, this will mean that most entries fall back to a torrent cache link rather than being rejected.) This is useful if you are using the [wiki:Plugins/download download] plugin as output, or if you are using the [wiki:Plugins/content_filter content_filter] or [wiki:Plugins/content_size content_size] plugins, which cannot get the required information from magnets.

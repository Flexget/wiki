= Magnets =
This plugin will remove any magnet links from the urls list, and reject any entries that only have magnet links. This is useful if you are using the [wiki:Plugins/download download] plugin as output, or if you are using the [wiki:Plugins/content_filter content_filter] or [wiki:Plugins/content_size content_size] plugins, which cannot get the required information from magnets.

=== Usage ===
{{{
magnets: no
}}}

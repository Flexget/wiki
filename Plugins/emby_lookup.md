#### Example

The most common use is to look up a movie title that can be used to format a pretty filename. This example uses `emby_movie_name` and `emby_movie_year` as parsed by emby_lookup in the [set](/Plugins/set) plugin to set `content_filename` (which the [deluge](/Plugins/deluge) plugin uses to rename the main file within a torrent).

```yaml
emby_lookup:
  host: http://emby.localhost:8096
  username: flexget
  password: flexget
  
set:
  content_filename: '{{ emby_movie_name }} ({{ emby_movie_year }})'
```

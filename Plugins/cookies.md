= Cookies =

Loads cookies from a file. Supports Firefox3, mozilla, and lwp cookie files.

=== Example ===

{{{
cookies: ~/.flexget/cookies.sqlite
}}}

== Types ==

This plugin will attempt to determine what type of cookies file you are using based on the extension.
||'''Extensions'''||'''Type'''||
||.txt||mozilla||
||.lwp||lwp||
||all others||firefox3||

If you would like to override this behavior, a cookie type can be specified manually like this:

{{{
cookies:
  file: /path/to/cookies.foo
  type: mozilla
}}}

'''Notes:'''
 - You cannot read cookies from running Firefox! Shutdown browsed and make a copy from `cookies.sqlite` to somewhere (ie. `~/.flexget`)
 - If you need the cookies from a logged in page (ie. The cookies get deleted when you close the browser), you should be able to use the command line to copy the cookies file to a directory of your choice.
 - Support for mozilla and lwp cookies was added in r1325
 - If you get an error saying "cookies.sqlite does not appear to be a valid Firefox 3 cookies file" and the file was generated by Firefox you might need to upgrade pysqlite2

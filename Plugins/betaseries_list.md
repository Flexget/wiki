= betaseries list =

This plugin creates an [wiki:Entry Entry] for each serie a betaseries member follows.

This plugin is useful for when used in a task with the [wiki:Plugins/import_series import_series] plugin to add series from your betaseries watchlist.

'''Notes:''' 

 * Like with other APIs used by !FlexGet the betaseries list is cached for 2 hours to avoid hammering.

              password: xxxxx

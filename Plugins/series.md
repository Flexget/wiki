# Series
Intelligent filter for TV-series.

## Features
 * Episode history aware, no duplicate downloads - refer to [seen](/Plugins/seen) plugin page for more information
 * Plenty of [quality](/Plugins/series/quality) options
 * [Timeframe](/Plugins/series/timeframe), when used with sort_by plugin, selects the entry best matching the criteria in given timeframe
 * [Proper & Repack](/Plugins/series/propers) aware
 * Specials aware (grabs episodes with the series title and the word 'special')
 * Tries to ignore season packs (if not configured explicitly to get them), you can use [content_size](/Plugins/content_size) for extra insurance against them.
 * Supports double episodes. i.e. S01E01-E02
 * [Series searching support](/Cookbook/Series/Search) (via [discover](/Plugins/discover) and [next_series_episodes](/Plugins/next_series_episodes) plugins)

**Simple configuration:**

```
series:
  - some series
  - another series
```

If `some series` and `another series` have understandable episode
numbering any given episode is downloaded only once. FlexGet should support all known episode numbering schemes without any configuration, including dates.

So if we get same episode twice:

 * Some.Series.S2E10.720p.x264-FlexGet
 * Some.Series.S2E10.HR.x264-FooBar

Only one of them is downloaded, with default configuration the first entry matching quality requirements is chosen. To get the best quality within specified timeframe use the sort_by plugin in the task.

```
sort_by:
  field: quality
  reverse: yes
```

#### Notes

* If the series appears in task(s) with slightly different naming conventions and spinoffs like FooBar and FooBar US read [this guide](/Plugins/series/closematch). 
* FlexGet respects *propers* which means that the same episode will be downloaded twice if the second one contains words such as `proper`, `repack`, `rerip`, or `real`.
* If series name is written in multiple different ways, don't add them as separate series. This will confuse episode tracking. 
* Check [series cookbook](/Cookbook/Series) for more complete examples and advanced uses.
* If using discover, existing collection can be imported with [this](/Cookbook/Series/SeedDB) recipe.

## `series` Commandline Arguments
The series plugin has several features available at the command line via the [`flexget series` command](/CLI/series).

## `execute` Commandline Arguments
There are also options to the `flexget execute` command which affect the series plugin:

Using `series begin` to set new starting point is recommended and should resolve any tracking issues. If you for some reason need to record episode into history it can be achieved with command `flexget inject "Pioneer One 05" --task <name> --learn`.


### \-\-stop-waiting \<name\>
Stops timeframe for given name, thus downloading any episode that is currently pending in the timeframe.

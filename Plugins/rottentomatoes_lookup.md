# Rotten Tomatoes lookup
Performs Rotten Tomatoes search for all entries in the feed and provides Rotten Tomatoes lookup functionality to other plugins.

Usually you don't need this, unless you know what you're doing :)

Example:

```
rottentomatoes_lookup: yes
```

An api key is included with FlexGet, but if you would like to specify an alternate one you can do so with the following config format:
```
rottentomatoes_lookup: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

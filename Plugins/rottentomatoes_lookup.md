= Rotten Tomatoes lookup =

Performs Rotten Tomatoes search for all entries in the feed and provides Rotten Tomatoes lookup functionality to other plugins.

Usually you don't need this, unless you know what you're doing :)

Example:

{{{
rottentomatoes_lookup: yes
}}}

An api key is included with !FlexGet, but if you would like to specify an alternate one you can do so with the following config format:
{{{
rottentomatoes_lookup: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
}}}

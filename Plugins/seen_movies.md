= Filter Seen Movies =

Prevents movies being downloaded twice.

How duplicate movie detection works:
 * Remembers all imdb, tmdb and trakt movie IDs from downloaded entries.
 * If stored ID appears again, entry is rejected.

== Configuration ==
=== Matching ===
There are two different operating modes, {{{strict}}} and {{{loose}}}.

Strict mode will reject all entries that have not been identified as movies. Loose mode will not intervene.

{{{
seen_movies: strict
}}}
or
{{{
seen_movies:
  matching: strict
}}}

=== Scope ===
By default this plugin will only allow a movie to be accepted once in any task. You can limit it to the current task by changing the scope to `local`.
{{{
seen_movies:
  scope: local
}}}

Reject already voted entries based on user imdb vote history.

To make this work you need to go ''Change display options'' in your imdb movie list and set display to all.

=== Example ===

{{{
imdb_rated: http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=<YOUR USER ID>
}}}

Note: in theory this should work on any other page containing list of imdb urls as well.

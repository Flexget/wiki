# Mock
Mainly for testing / development.

### Example
```
mock:
  - {title: 'Name.Of.The.Series.S01E01.XviD-FlexGet', url: 'http://some.url.com/12345'}
```

URL can be left out in which case random url (to localhost) will be generated.

You can specify any field with the mock you like (like description, guid, imdb_url etc)

= Accept = 

Entries matching regexp will be accepted.
Non matching entries are not intervened.

Example:

{{{
imdb:
  min_score: 6.4
accept:
  - rush.hour.3
}}}

Now rush hour 3 will be passed even if imdb filter would cause it
to be filtered because of min_score.

See module [wiki:FilterPatterns patterns] documentation for full syntax.
Unconditionally supports {{{not}}} and {{{path}}} directives like [wiki:FilterPatterns patterns].

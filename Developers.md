If you're working on good re-usable plugin we're be more than happy to include it in official distribution. See [Contribute](/Contribute) for more information.

## Unit testing
FlexGet has over 1200 unit tests so chances are that if your modifications pass the tests nothing major has been broken.

## Running IPython inside FlexGet

```

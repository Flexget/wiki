= Why Trac and svn ? =

 * !FlexGet was started before !GitHub or !BitBucket even existed in relevant form.
 * Our build system is integrated with svn revision numbering, of course this could be changed but it requires effort.
 * !GitHub and !BitBucket don't really allow making nice site for a project like Trac wiki does (current flexget.com). Who writes us new site?
 * We have SVN hooks .. who remakes them with git?
 * Hudson needs to be reconfigured .. who does that?

=== How about some !GitHub presence? ===

Sure, if someone provides us scripts to sync !GitHub <-> SVN ...

'''In short, change requires more effort than we (I) am willing to put into it! '''

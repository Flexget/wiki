= Why Trac and svn ? =

 * !FlexGet was started before !GitHub or !BitBucket even existed in relevant form.
 * Our build system is integrated with svn revision numbering, of course this could be changed but it requires effort.
 * !GitHub and !BitBucket don't really allow making nice site for a project like Trac wiki does (current flexget.com). Who writes us new site?
 * We have SVN hooks .. who remakes them with callbacks?
 * Hudson needs to be reconfigured .. who does that?
 * Trac sucks with !GitHub, the integration is not just at the level where it is with svn.

=== How about some !GitHub presence? ===

Sure, if someone provides us scripts to sync !GitHub <-> SVN ... I know we would slightly more patches being present in !GitHub.

'''In short, change requires more effort than we are / I am willing to put into it at the moment! '''

=== Github svn sync ===

The goal:
- Have a standardized framework for metainfo providers, so that plugins which require metainfo aren't coupled so tightly to one specific metainfo provider.
- Let the user customize priority and which providers are allowed in the task.
- Allow requesting a metainfo lookup for a certain category (series, movies, etc.)

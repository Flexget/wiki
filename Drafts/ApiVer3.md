We're planning to move away from task.entries and instead pass iterable to the plugin, new method signature will be:

{{{
def on_task_xxx(self, task, config, entries):
}}}

== Iterating entries ==

This is still the open question.

=== Option 1 - helpers ===

{{{
from flexget.entry import accepted, rejected, undecided

# and then iterating
for entry in accepted(entries):
  pass

for entry in accepted(undecided(entries)):
  pass
}}}

* Old task.entries contained undecided AND accepted, iterating them like this feels messy
* Requires imports

=== Option 2 - generator expression ===

{{{
for entry in (e.accepted for e in entries):
  e.reject()
}}}

* Slightly more verbose
* Feels very pythonic and is very explicit
* Iterating the old task.entries is even more verbose - and we do this most

{{{
for entry in (e.accepted or e.undecided for e in entries):
  e.reject()
}}}


=== Option 3 - properties ===

If/since our entries is custom list class, we could use properties from it.

{{{
for entry in entries.accepted:
  entry.reject()
}}}

* Similar problem, how to loop through old task.entries
* I'm not aware of any other python iterable that has built in filtering methods

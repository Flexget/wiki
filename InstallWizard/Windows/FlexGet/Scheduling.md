= Configure =

Follow the [wiki:Configure configuration tutorial].

Some windows specific tips:

You can place the configuration file where you like. One good place is `C:\Documents and Settings\<your user>\.flexget\config.yml` as this location is automatically checked regardless where you execute `flexget` command. Another logical choice would be `c:\program files\flexget\config.yml`. If you opt later you may need to specify the configuration file explicitly with `flexget -c <config>`

== Scheduling ==

Once you've created basic configuration file, you need to schedule executing !FlexGet command.

Follow instructions [http://lonewolf-online.net/computers/kb/windows/guide-windows-task-scheduler/ here].

== And you're done ==

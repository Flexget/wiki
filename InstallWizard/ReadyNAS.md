It should be perfectly possible to install !FlexGet on ReadyNAS. Unfortunately nobody has yet written down how it should be done.

Following [wiki:InstallWizard/Linux Linux] guide should work with some additional steps.

There's a thread in ReadyNAS forums [http://www.readynas.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=36&t=42794&p=254391 here].

If you install, please update this wiki ...

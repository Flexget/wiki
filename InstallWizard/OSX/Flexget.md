## Install FlexGet

Finally, install FlexGet and its components (using `pip3` in place of `pip` if necessary):
```bash
$ pip install --upgrade flexget
```

You can confirm FlexGet has been successfully installed by running the following command:
```bash
$ flexget -V
```
This should output the version number of FlexGet.

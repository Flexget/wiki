# [Install Wizard](/InstallWizard) > [OSX](/InstallWizard/OSX) > FlexGet

## Install FlexGet

Finally, install FlexGet and its components (using `pip3` in place of `pip` if necessary):
```bash
$ pip install --upgrade flexget
```

Alternatively, if you have homebrew installed, you could use the version in homebrew
```bash
$ brew install flexget
```

You can confirm FlexGet has been successfully installed by running the following command:
```bash
$ flexget -V
```
This should output the version number of FlexGet.

Next, learn how to [autorun the daemon](/InstallWizard/OSX/Autorun) at startup.

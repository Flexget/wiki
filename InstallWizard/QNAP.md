For Python 2.7 on QNAP perform the following steps,

1) Install the QNAP Optware QPKG from the web GUI

2) Log in to your NAS via ssh

3) Enter the commands

{{{
ipkg install python27
ipkg install py27-setuptools
easy_install-2.7 flexget
}}}

If you want to use Transmission then enter the command
{{{
easy_install-2.7 transmissionrpc
}}}

To test it is working use the command
{{{
python2.7 /opt/local/bin/flexget -V
}}}

Create your config.yml file in the directory /opt/local/

Put an entry in your cron to lauch flexget every 10 mins

# Builtin
These plugins are always enabled on all feeds even when they are not present in configuration file. Builtin plugins are usually internal utilities that perform different tasks like rejecting already downloaded items (example filter [seen](/Plugins/seen)).

You can disable builtin plugins with [disable](/Plugins/disable)

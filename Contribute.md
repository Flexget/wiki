= Contributing to !FlexGet =

We very much appreciate any contributions to the project, you don't even necessarily need to do any coding! There's really good blog post how to contribute [http://blog.smartbear.com/programming/14-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-being-a-programming-genius-or-a-rock-star/ here].

For code submissions we accept (in order of preference):

* !GitHub pull requests to the develop branch (These are strongly preferred! It is much easier for us to do code reviews and merge these in. You can find a [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo guide] here.)
* Patch files as ticket attachments
* Just plain file attachments if above are too intimidating

If you really want to make us happy, make sure your changes pass PEP8 guidelines. We have task for checking them. You can run it via

{{{
bin/paver pep8
}}}

Any & additional unit tests are also huge bonus.

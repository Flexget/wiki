== Checkout from SVN ==

If you're familiar with subversion and want to stay in bleeding edge you can checkout directly from development repository.

{{{
svn co http://svn.flexget.com/trunk flexget-dev
}}}

For more stable release you may wish to checkout from branch 0.9 which will be in stable mode until 1.0 is released.

{{{
svn co http://svn.flexget.com/branches/0.9/ flexget-0.9
}}}

== Update from SVN ==

Enter path where you did checkout and run

{{{
svn update
}}}

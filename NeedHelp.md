= Having troubles? =

If you're having problems getting something to work that should clearly work (by wiki) do not hesitate to ask help.

=== Through IRC ===

I'm on ircnet, efnet, quakenet and wordforge under nick paranoidi. I may not be able to answer immediately.
You may also have some luck in #rtorrent at freenode.

=== Through Trac ===

Create ticket and describe your problem, use ticket type help.

=== Through mail ===

You can try to reach me at marko.koivusalo at gmail.com.

= Feedback =

I'm always interested in feedback, may it be good or bad. Especially when you decide not to use !FlexGet, tell me why so I can work to resolve those issues.

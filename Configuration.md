= Configuration =

In order to use !FlexGet you'll need to create a configuration file. By default !FlexGet tries to find {{{config.yml}}} from it's installation directory. In case if you decide to use other filename, path or wish to use multiple different configuration files you must specify configuration file via -c parameter. If file is in !FlexGet directory you don't need to give full path.

!FlexGet uses [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaml Yaml] markup in configuration file. 

= File structure =

Mandatory file structure has been kept minimal. Each configuration file must have structure of:

{{{
feeds:
  feed A:
    <feed configuration here>
    .
    .
  feed B:
    <feed configuration here>
    .
    .
}}}

'''Most common mistakes among new users is indentation level and missing colons, pay special attention to these when looking examples and documentation.'''

== Feed configuration ==

This depends largely on what you're trying to accomplish. Let's assume that you're trying to get stuff out from RSS-feed. First you'll need to add [wiki:InputRSS rss] (input) module. Notice how RSS is indented by 2 spaces, this is because it belongs to a feed (or think "my feed" has "rss"). This will create items (called [wiki:Entry entries]) from entire RSS feed.

{{{
feeds:
  my feed:
    rss: http://example.com/rss
}}}

If you don't want to get everything from the RSS feed you'll need to sort out the content you're interested about. This happens trough various [wiki:Modules#Filters filters]. Most commonly [wiki:FilterPatterns patterns] module. Notice how patterns list is indented once again by 2 additional spaces. This is because they belong to patterns.

{{{
feeds:
  my feed:
    rss: http://example.com/rss
    patterns:
      - my.interesting.show
      - another.interesting.show
}}}

And you probably want to download the result as well, so let's throw output module [wiki:OutputDownload download] in as well.

{{{
feeds:
  my feed:
    rss: http://example.com/rss
    patterns:
      - my.interesting.show
      - another.interesting.show
    download: /home/myself/podcasts/
}}}

When you create or modify configuration try running !FlexGet with --check parameter. It will go trough configuration file and report any irregularities. If you used default configuration file name simply execute {{{./flexget.py --check}}}.

If --check does not find any problems you have successfully created fully working configuration file, that wasn't so hard was it? In reality when dealing with tv-series you may wish to use [wiki:FilterSeries series] filter instead of patterns.

Continue into [wiki:Modules modules] to learn all about modules you may use in you configuration file. You can also [wiki:Install#Manualexecution execute your configuration file] now.

== Still confused about Yaml? ==

Please note that each indentation level must be precisely '''2 spaces'''. Tabs are forbidden for indentation. Why are indentation even required in Yaml? It is used for semantics or '''relation'''. Consider example:

{{{
pets:
  cat:
    name: furry
    age: 5
  dog:
    name: barks a lot
    age: 2
    toys:
      - bone
      - ball
}}}

Here we have two pets, cat and dog. Each of them has name, and age. Dog has list of toys. If we were to use more conventional configuration file format it would be much messier to represent item relations.

Some other file formats could represent this in form:

{{{
pets.cat.name=furry
pets.cat.age=5
pets.dog.name=barks a lot
pets.dog.age=2
pets.dog.toys=bone, ball
}}}

But this gets quite difficult to follow in more complex situations.

To grab a series from NZBClub.com you can use their RSS feed, but it needs some urlrewrite and the filenames are absolutely terrible by default. Requires version r1333 or newer.[[BR]]

Here is an example for the feed http://nzbclub.com/nzbfeed.aspx?ps=teevee&sa=1&sp=1 - it's a RSS feed for everything the user teevee posted (you can create your own feed for different subjects at nzbclub.com).[[BR]]

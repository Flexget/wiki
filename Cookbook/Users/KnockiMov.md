== Flexget 1.2.313 configuration - TV & movies using showRSS and IMDB-watchlist ==

For this to work you have to setup a few things.

* Setup your favorite torrent-client and have it look in a folder for new torrents. In this configuration I use transmission.[[BR]] Read here for installation instructions: [http://flexget.com/wiki/InstallWizard]
* Find a good feed for your series. I highly recommend using showRSS [http://showrss.info]
* You have to find your userID at IMDB look at http://www.imdb.com/user/XXXXXXXXXX/ (the XX.. is your IMDB-userID).
* Create a new e-mail with Gmail or use your existing one for e-mailnotifications.[[BR]] Template goes into [flexdir]/templates/

The watchlist you specify in this configuration have to be public for FlexGet to read it.

I had to make a small change to the file search_kat.py for the plugin to work as it pointed to the old adress kickass.to

All thanks to user UnNefer for his e-mail-template from his own guide: http://flexget.com/wiki/Cookbook/Users/UnNefer

# Built to work with both movies and series populated with IMDB-watchlist and
# showRSS and automatically send an e-mail with news with what was added
# and/or downloaded with transmission using its watch-folder.

# Templates for easy configuration

# First we give a global-template that will be owned by all tasks that will be run.
# Remember to change your username, password and your host for transmission.
# For e-mail to work, change sending/recieving e-mail and passord. This uses gMail.

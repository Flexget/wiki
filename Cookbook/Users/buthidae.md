'''Current version - 1.2.258'''

This config runs tasks to perform the following actions:

1) Grab an RSS feed, download desired series from it, and download the .torrent files to a watched folder
2) Grab an RSS feed, download all items from it, and download the .torrent files to a watched folder
3) Use the [http://flexget.com/wiki/Cookbook/AutomaticRarUnpack AutomaticRarUnpack] recipe to check the seeding folder for .rar files, and extract them to a "new videos" folder
4) Check the seeding folder for completed .avi, .mkv. or .mp4 files, and copy them to a "new videos" folder
5) Check the "new videos" folder for TV show files, and clean up the naming style

The config is styled towards running on Mac OS X, but should be easily modified for any OS.

Each task will send a Prowl notification on completion. A secrets file is used for confidentiality and ease of repetition.

Some TV show files on my site-of-choice come named ''series.name.xyy.quality.ext'' instead of ''series.name.SxxEyy.quality.ext''. The "Rename Copied TV Shows" task uses regexp supplied by the "renameshows" template to reformat everything to ''Series Name.SxxEyy.quality.ext''. Because it places the renamed file in to the same folder, the [http://flexget.com/wiki/Plugins/seen Seen plugin] actions the file twice. You could move the files to another folder to avoid this - I've chosen not to. Seen is also run in local mode to avoid messing up episode order or erroneously skipping files.

Finally, because we have a [http://flexget.com/wiki/InstallWizard/OSX Mac OS X LaunchAgent] calling the script every 15 minutes, the [http://flexget.com/wiki/Plugins/Daemon/scheduler Secheduler] plugin is turned off.

I've put in lots of comments on stuff that I struggled with while I was learning :-)

'''Adrellias flexget config'''

My config file is mostly based off the below users configuration.   

[https://github.com/atlanta800/dotfiles/tree/master/flexget atlanta800] (now on github, old page [wiki:Cookbook/UserAtlanta800 here])::

He has a lot of just sane settings! I wanted a automated setup that someone that does not know how to, add things to a config file could use. 
A spouse for instance. So my config uses [http://trakt.tv/] to generate rss based searches without having to add the new series to a config file every time. 

So i use the discover plugin with trakt_list to generate input feeds rss searches dynamically.

This is just a extract of what i have changed in atlanta800's config file

{{{
  # This preset is a "global" preset for all TV-related feeds.
  # We keep all of the RSS feeds that list tv-related torrents here
  # as well as where to check existing shows.
  tv-global:
    # This will search my trakt.tv custom list called tvshows and then use search_rss to search for those shows 
    discover:
      what:
        - trakt_list:
        # Use trakt.tv watchlist to get series names 
            username: trakusername
            password: trakpassword
            api_key: trakapikey
            custom: tvshows
            strip_dates: yes
      from:
        # Then search ezrss for the shows found in the watchlist - This could do away with series.yml
        - search_rss: https://www.ezrss.it/search/index.php?show_name={{search_term}}&mode=rss
        - search_rss: http://torrentz.eu/feed?q={{search_term}}
        #- search_rss: http://kat.ph/search/{{search_term}}/?rss=1 # This feed seems to have alot of mixed languages
      type: any
}}}

This is the only thing i have in my feeds for series.


{{{
# This is where we pull everything together
feeds:

  # All of the TV-related feeds pull in the tv-global preset, this gives
  # all of the necessary rss sources and a few extra configs

    priority: 1
    preset:

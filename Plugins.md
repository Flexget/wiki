# Plugins
Plugins provide most of the functionality in FlexGet. Plugins usually create, manipulate or download **[entries](/Entry)** but they can also change how FlexGet operates. Many plugins can use the **[Jinja2 ](/Jinja)** template system.

Most plugins are enabled by placing a keyword and required settings in a configuration file. All plugins listed below are included in the FlexGet package (with the exception of the third-party plugins section). This documentation is meant for latest released version.

## Indentation in examples
All configuration examples are assumed to be placed under a task (or template.) So if documentation has this example:

```yaml
series:
  - name
```

In a full configuration, this goes into:

```yaml
tasks:
  task_name:
    rss: http://example.com
    series:
      - name
```

This makes examples more compact and reduces unnecessary boilerplate.


## Inputs
Produce **[entries](/Entry)** from external source.  
Most requests are cached so there is no penalty for using the same RSS URL multiple times in the configuration, for example.

**Note:** If you are looking for torrent search plugins, refer to [Search Plugins](/Searches).

= Search =

Use entry title and try to search it from supported sites. Accepts list of search modules in order of priority. If entry is not found from any of the sites it will be rejected.

This should be used only when there is no other way to get working download URL, ie. when input module does not provide any relevant URLs.

Example:

{{{
search:
  - newtorrents
  - piratebay
}}}
